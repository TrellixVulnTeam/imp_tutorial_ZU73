description: >
    This tutorial introduces the Python Modeling Interface (PMI), a set
    of tools designed to handle all steps of the modeling protocol, and
    demonstrates it by modeling the stalk of RNA Polymerase II using
    cross-linking, electron microscopy, and x-ray crystallography data.
prereqs: [python/scikit, python/matplotlib]
