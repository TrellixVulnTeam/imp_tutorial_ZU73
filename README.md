## Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP) Tutorial
----------------------------------

IMP is a tool to generate structural models based on multiple sources of experimental data.  A detailed explanation of IMP and integrative modeling is given [here](http://www.integrativemodeling.org/2.3.1/doc/tutorial/)

### This tutorial explores scripts that:

* Show the basic capabilities of IMP
* Sample models of RNA Polymerase II using Electron Microscopy density and chemical crosslinks
* Visualize these models and analyze them for accuracy and precision


### Running the Tutorial
All instructions for the tutorial are contined in the [tutorial wiki](https://github.com/salilab/imp_tutorial/wiki)
